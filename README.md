# Emotion-Recognition-using-Spatio-Temporal-Data
Emotion Recognition using Spatio-Temporal Data, applied on REVDESS Dataset, to predict 8 emotion, based on the Video(Spatio) and Audio(Temporal) Data.
* It is a multi-modal learning:
  * Where for the Spatial features a Convolutional Neural Networks are used.
  * For the Audio Temporal Data a variant of RNN called LSTM is used.
### Preprocessing the data before feeding it to the model.
